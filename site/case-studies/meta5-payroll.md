case-solution: "In a two-phased approach, meta5 first downloaded employee and scheduling information, then transformed, reformatted and entered the data into a SQL database. A meta5 scheduling CAPSULE® identified when new shifts started and ended, triggering 5000 customized daily text messages that reminded employees to log in and log out—and improved payroll accuracy by XX%. In phase 2, meta5 data integration allowed Community Care to pre-calculate weekly payroll, then text each employee a report to review and proactively correct errors—delivering a significant increase in payroll accuracy and time savings for the finance team."
