case-solution: "To reduce time collecting data and ensuring reports reflected timely, accurate data, meta5 created a proprietary, all-inclusive data warehouse in SQLServer with ETL extraction routines running on a nightly basis. meta5 also built a Product Detail Report (PDR) that detailed the SKU data lifecycle for every SKU across hundreds of stores. To scale across the organization, meta5also built starter-set applications using CAPSULEÂ® Technology that served as a foundational template for future use cases. "
